# Introduction

In this sample repository we have a .NET 8 Web App with a XUnit test project, without any workflow in it, however because of the workflow required defined in the ruleset at the organization level, you can see the workflow being executed and you can check the logs [here](https://github.com/dsanchezcr-ignite23/sample-repo/actions).

This is a great use case to have required workflows executed to validate build processes, testing, code analysis, and more.
