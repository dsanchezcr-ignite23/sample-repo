# Introduction

In this sample repository we have a .NET 8 Web App with a XUnit test project, without any workflow in it, the status checks are being executed because of the ruleset defined that we have at the organization level, you can check the logs [here](https://github.com/dsanchezcr-ignite23/sample-repo/actions).

This is a great use case to have required workflows execute to validate build processes, testing, code analysis, and more.
